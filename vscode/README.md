## If install script fails
If running `python install-extensions.py` throws an error of `sh: code: command not found`, you will need to install Visual Studio Code's `code` CLI command in order to run the install script.  

To do this, open the command palette in Visual Studio Code, type `shell`, and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.
