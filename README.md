List of Visual Studio Code extensions I use with install script, as well as user settings.

## If install script fails
If running `python install.py` throws an error of `sh: code: command not found`, you will need to install Visual Studio Code's `code` CLI command in order to run the install script.  

To do this, open the command palette (shift+command+p on Mac), type `shell`, and select `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.
